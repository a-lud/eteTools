# EteTools

This is a simple tool I've written to parse output from [`ETE3 evol`][ete] and write summary CSV files.
The tools uses [BioPython][bpy] to interface with the CodeML output files. Calculation of the LRT statistic
has been based off the [method used][lrt] in the ETE3 evol software.

# Required python modules

The tools requires the following non-standard python libraries.

- [Pandas][pd]
- [SciPy][spy]
- [BioPython][bpy]

## How to use

`EteTools` has been designed to be used in a custom Nextflow pipeline, but can work on any output directory
generated by `ete evol`. The tool parses the `CodeML` output file in each model directory to get key
information. It then uses this information to:

- Perform LRT statistics for all valid comparisons (comparisons the same as those from `ETE3 evol`)
- Create concatenated summary tables for each model type
- Report the sites under selection (BEB) - TODO

For usage examples, simply call the help page:

```bash
usage: eteTools.py [-h] [-m [MODELS ...]] /path/to/input /path/to/outdir

    # -------------------------------------------------------- #
    #                ETE3 Evol output-to-table                 #
    # -------------------------------------------------------- #

    This is a simple script that parses the output of ETE3 evol
    and returns a series of informative tables. This tool
    provides a little more flexibility than just using the std-
    out from the ETE3 evol tool.

    ------------------------------------------------------------


positional arguments:
  /path/to/input        Directory path to ETE3 evol results
  /path/to/outdir       Pipeline output directory

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

# Nextflow pipeline

I've implemented this tool in my nextflow pipeline that can be found [here][nf]
